/* read it as if you were wrong once. --> "why is this wrong??"

 * basic strategy:
  * don't be obsessed with speed or memory when the input is small compared to limit
  * internalization of problem statements
  * simplify. a step-by-step approach
  * readability is important
  * keep calm
  
 * stuff you should look for
  * 0-based or 1-based?
  * int overflow, array bounds
  * special cases (n=1?)
  * do smth instead of nothing and stay organized
  * WRITE STUFF DOWN
  * DON'T GET STUCK ON ONE APPROACH
  
 * after solving the problem
  * consider whether there is another way.
  * reduce memory, time, codes, ...
  * what is my weakness that need to be addressed by solving this problem?
